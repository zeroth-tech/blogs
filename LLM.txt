# Zeroth Technology Blog

> A technical blog focused on blockchain, cryptographic systems, and digital identity verification

## About

This blog (https://zeroth.tech/blogs) is maintained by Zeroth Technology and serves as a platform for sharing research and insights on emerging technologies. We explore novel solutions to real-world problems in distributed systems, blockchain applications, and identity verification.

## Topics

- **Digital Identity & Authentication**: Cryptographic visual signatures, AI deepfake prevention, real-time video authentication
- **Blockchain & Smart Contracts**: Ethereum development, NFTs, tokenization strategies, decentralized attestation
- **Context Units (CxUs)**: Our novel approach to distributed knowledge management with content-addressable storage
- **Supply Chain Innovation**: Enterprise blockchain solutions, product-oriented data structures
- **Cryptographic Systems**: Zero-knowledge proofs, visual cryptography, secure authentication protocols

## Key Projects

- **Blinky Light Thing (BLT)**: A cryptographic solution for real-time video authentication and deepfake prevention
- **Context Units Framework**: A system for creating verifiable, distributed knowledge structures
- **Product Tokens**: Smart contract implementations for supply chain tokenization
- **Visual Signatures**: Novel approach to human-verifiable cryptographic authentication
